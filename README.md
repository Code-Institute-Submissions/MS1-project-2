  <h3 align="center">Ashly Kerkhof Acting Page</h3>

  <p align="center">
    The idea is too make it so accessable that people will be able to see the work i have done,
    plus all of the information about me such as; my career and life, my cv, my showreel and all of my headshots in one place.</p>
<p align="center">
    inspiriation was taken from a lot of portfolios on the interent, i looked at many acting pages, and took inspiration from the things i liked,
    such as the hover gallery. I really wanted it to be slick and accessible to everyone.

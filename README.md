Welcome to my Actors webpage, this is designed to make casting directors and directors access my work at a click of a button.

the idea is too make it so accessable that people will be able to see the work i have done,
plus all of the information about me such as; my career and life, my cv, my showreel and all of my headshots in one place.

inspiriation was taken from a lot of portfolios on the interent, i looked at many acting pages, and took inspiration from the things i liked,
such as the hover gallery. I really wanted it to be slick and accessible to everyone.

the languages used are HTML, CSS and Javascript. i also have imported some code from Float panel and have used standard bootstrap code.
